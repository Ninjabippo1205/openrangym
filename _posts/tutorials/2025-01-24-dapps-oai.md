dApps are real-time microservices designed to operate within the O-RAN ecosystem, enabling sub-10 ms Artificial Intelligence (AI) routines in the Radio Access Network (RAN). 
This tutorial demonstrates how to set up and leverage our dApp framework with OpenAirInterface (OAI) to perform spectrum sharing. 
Additionally, we provide guidance on how this framework can be adapted to other use cases in 5G and beyond.

The dApp framework is designed for co-location with the CU/DU, where it can interact directly with user-plane data.
The modularity of our framework ensures flexibility, allowing developers to tailor it to various spectrum-sharing scenarios or extend it for other AI-driven optimizations in network management.
It features:
- **Extensibility:** Modular design of the classes that can be extended for custom use cases.
- **Adaptability:** Works with diverse configurations, including over-the-air (OTA) environments and wireless testing platforms like Colosseum.
- **Real-Time Capabilities:** Designed to meet the sub-10 ms latency requirements of O-RAN, with control loops periodicity below 1 Î¼s.

This tutorial outlines the setup process and discusses how to customize the framework for different applications.

### Framework Setup

We set up a repository that connects our OAI version and our dApp framework. Cloning such repository will already download all the necessary components as well:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/wineslab/dApp-framework
```
The following parts of this tutorial assume that the repositories have not been downloaded in this way.
Disregard the cloning of the repositories if you have used this command.

#### Setting Up the gNB
1. **Clone and Build OAI**  
   Clone the OAI repository and include the `--build-e3` flag to enable dApp support:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wineslab/dApp-openairinterface5g openairinterface5g
   cd openairinterface5g
   source oaienv
   cd ./cmake_targets/
   ./build_oai -I  # Install dependencies (do it only once)
   ./build_oai -w USRP --ninja --gNB --build-e3
   ```

2. **Launch OAI**  
   Run OAI before starting the dApp, ensuring the `do_SRS` flag is set to 0. Example:
   ```bash
   taskset -ca 0-45 ./nr-softmodem -O <CONFIG_FILE_PATH> --gNBs.[0].min_rxtxtime 6 --sa --usrp-tx-thread-config 1 -E --T_stdout 2 --gNBs.[0].do_SRS 0
   ```

#### Setting Up the dApp

**Prerequisites**: Make sure that `python3` and `hatch` are installed in your system.
```bash
  pip install hatch
```
For more details on how to install `hatch` please refer to the [official website](https://hatch.pypa.io/).
We will soon update a stable version of the `dapp` package on the official python repositories, thus these steps are intended to be conducted only to test the example Spectrum Sharing dApp.

1. **Clone the dApp Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wineslab/dApp-library dApp
   cd dApp
   ```
2. **Build and install the python package**
   ```bash
      hatch build
      pip3 install dist/*.tar.gz
   ```
3. **Run the dApp**  
   Start the dApp with customizable arguments to adapt it for different scenarios:
   ```bash
   taskset -ca 0-45 python3 examples/sprectrum_dapp.py --ota --control --save-iqs
   ```
   Key options include:
    - **`--ota`:** Enable OTA configuration.
    - **`--control`:** Activate PRB blocking for spectrum management.
    - **`--save-iqs`:** Collect and save I/Q samples for offline analysis.

#### Example Application: Spectrum Sharing

The included tutorial demonstrates a dApp for spectrum sharing. The same setup can be used for several use cases including:
- **Dynamic Spectrum Allocation:** Implement algorithms to assign PRBs based on real-time traffic demands.
- **Spectrum Sensing:** Analyze I/Q samples to detect and mitigate interference.

Moreover, our framework can be extended by changing the E3SM implemented to support different payloads for the Indication Messages and the control actions, unlocking additional use cases.
For more information about the use cases that benefit from the usage of dApps, please refer to the [O-RAN nGRG Research Report nGRG-RR-2024-10](https://mediastorage.o-ran.org/ngrg-rr/nGRG-RR-2024-10-dApp%20use%20cases%20and%20requirements.pdf)
The E3AP does not need any change and can be used as it is.

### Use dApps on Colosseum

The framework presented in this tutorial is also available as a linux container on Colosseum. The name of the container is `oai-dapp` with password `dapps`.
To replicate this tutorial on Colosseum, create a reservation with at least four different nodes in the same order as presented here:
{: .text-justify}

- `oai-5gcore-2024`: Core for OAI that allows the identification and pairing of the UE to the network. Password for this container is `pass`. 
A detailed tutorial that describes how the core and OAI work on Colosseum is present [here](/tutorials/oai-tutorial);
- `oai-dapp`: our container that will act as a gNB with a dApp embedded;
- `oai-dapp`: our container that will act as a UE;
- `cast`: container from [[1]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3556564.3558243), used om this case as an external incumbent. Password for this container is `cast123`;

More details about the commands will be posted here soon.

[//]: # (Once the reservation has been deployed, start a Radio Frequency &#40;RF&#41; scenario on Colosseum, e.g., scenario `10011` &#40;All Paths 0dB, 3.6GHz for center frequency, 10 nodes max&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (colosseumcli rf start 10011 -c)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Run the OAI 5G Core-network as indicated in the [original tutorial]&#40;/tutorials/oai-tutorial&#41;:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (cd oai-cn5g)

[//]: # (docker compose up -d)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Access the first `oai-dapp` container and start the gNB operations with the following list of commands:)

[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (sa)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Through these commands, precisely in &#40;this file&#41;[] the dApp is also created and turned on.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (With the flag `--demo-gui`, you should be able to access a webpage on your browser that shows the I/Q samples sensed by the gNB and delivered by to the dApp.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ([//]: # &#40;<img src="/assets/post-assets/dapps.png" class="post-image" alt="dApp dashboard normal" width="75%">&#41;)
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Subsequently, access the second `oai-dapp` container and start the UE operations:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```bash)

[//]: # (sa)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Since the sensed I/Qs are extracted from a reserved OFDM slot, the UE communication will not be shown in the web interface.)

[//]: # (Finally, access the incumbent container and start a Uniform noise with the command:)

[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (```)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The expected output is that the dApp is able to detect the presence of a signal on the incumbent and block the PRBs affected.)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # (#### Python package)

[//]: # (The dApp framework serves as a versatile tool for real-time RAN optimization. )

[//]: # (While this tutorial focuses on spectrum sharing, the framework can be adapted to numerous other applications, making it a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the O-RAN ecosystem.)
